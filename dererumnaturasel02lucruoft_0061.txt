LUCRETIUS V. 1291-131 2

1291. ollis: archaic form of illis, so in l. 1390, not uncommon
in Vergil. The construction is dativus commodi.

1292. inerma: a rare form, found in Cic. Fam. xi. 12. 1 ‘ cum
paucis inermis‘ and also in Sallust. Lucretius has also ii. 845
sterila for sterilia, i. 340 ‘ sublima for sublimia, ii. 1122 hilaro for
hilari.

1294. species, ‘the very appearance of a copper sickle,’ or
possibly only a Lucretian periphrasis for salx. Duff renders it,
though not so forcibly, ‘ the fashion.’ In Vergil the sickle becomes
the sword, Georg. i. 508 ‘et curvae rigidum falces conflantur in
ensem'. For versaque in opprobrium, v. l. obscenum, ‘fell into
disgrace‚' cf. l. 1357 ‘ vitio vertere ’.

1295. This line amplifies l. 1286.

1296. exaequata: as the Romans found the iron sword of their
legionaries gave them a great advantage over the copper sword of
the German tribes, which bent at every blow. But when all men
used iron swords then the fights were contested on equal terms.

creperi, ‘ wavering ' ; originally dusky, obscure, hence uncer-
tain = amzffltz’s Martis.

1297. prius est, ‘it is an earlier custom ; cf. antefuz’l, 1. 1380.

conscendere is a substantive and is subject to est.

1298. moderarier : for the form see note on 1. 934. Here
moderarier governs the accusative, in l. 1312 it takes the dative.

dextraque vigere, ‘to show prowess with the right hand,'
while the left holds the bridle.

1300. We have the same construction in this line as in l. 1297.

1301. falciferos: Livy uses the word falcatus. The Britons,
Gauls, and Germans employed these scythe-wheeled chariots.

1302. boves lucas: so called because the Romans first saw
elephants in Lucania in the army of King Pyrrhus, as the story is
told in Plin. N. H. viii. 6. 16.

turrito τ so in Sil. Ital. iv. 601 ‘ vis elephantorum turrito
concita dorso' ; cf. the quotation from Livy on 1. 1315.

1303. anguimanus: as in ii. 537 ‘anguimanus elephantos’ ;
Ov. Mel. i. 184 ‘anguipedmn’

1305. alid: for aliud, as in 11. 257, 1456.

1306. quod is final relative.

1307. in dies: see note on 1. 1279.

. augmen: a favourite word with Lucretius, in other writers it
is rare.

1308. in moenere belli, ‘in the service of war.’ Hannibal used
oxen with another object, when he fastened lighted saggots on their
horns to mislead the Romans.

1310. partim=nonnulli3 see the note on l. 1143 for the con-
struction.

1311. No distinction between doctoribus and magistris is
intended.

1312. qui is final relative.

moderarier: with dative, contrast l. 1298. For the form see
note on . 934.
