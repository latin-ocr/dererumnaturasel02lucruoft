LUCRETIUS V. 1 23 7-64

1237. dubiaeque minantur, ‘threaten to fall.’ Duff compares
Sein. N·-D; vi. 1. 2 ‘oppidi pars ruit dubieque stant etiam quae
re icta sint .

1239. relinquunt=tribuebant‚ l. 1172, ‘assign.'

1240. in rebus : i. e. in things on earth.

quae is consecutive.

1241. quod superest=rocafira μὲν δὴ ταῦτα, so much for that,
‘to continue '; it marks a transition. Cf. note on l. 1113.

1242. argenti pondus, plumbi potestas. Lucretius is very
fond of periphrasis, and instead of naming the material or substance
alone he prefers to add to it its especial properties or qualities ; cf.
1. 1286 ‘ferri vis aerisque ’‚ 1. 1281 ‘ferri natura ⁹.

potestas, ‘the potentiality ’ 01 ‘ useful qualities ’.

1245. bellum silvestre : the mode of warfare natural to savage
tribes and primitive man.

1246. formidinis ergo: ‘to inspire terror ⁷ : ergo, ‘for the sake
of‚' is found in Cato, Livy, Cicero, and Vergil, yet it was held by
those who used it to be an archaic preposition.

1248. pandere, ‘to clear’ or ‘open up' = φιλοῦν. Duff also
compares ψιλὴ γῆ, ‘arable land.'

pascua: adjective and predicative‚ ‘fit for pasture.'

1250. fovea, ‘pitfall ’3 so in Hor. Ep. i. 16. 50 ‘ cautus enim

metuit foveam lupus '.
igni: amative, as in 1. 12543 see l. 930.
venarier: a substantival infinitive; for the form see note on

1252. quidquid id est, ‘ whatever the cause may be.’

1254. percoxerat: the heat penetrated into the very vitals ofthe
earth.

igni: as in 1. 1250.

1255. See note on 1. 911. venis ferventibus, ‘ from the glowing
vems.'

1257. concreta ε i. e. cooled and moulded into lumps; cf. 1. 798.

videbant=the optative of indefinite frequency, a Graecism
frequently imitated by Livy.

1259. levi, ‘smooth and polished.’

1260. ‘ Moulded into §hapes similar to the outlines of the cavities
in which each lump lay.'

simili atque : see note on 1. 1066. ,

1262. penetrabat eos, ‘ it gradually occurred to them ⁷ ε the word
implies that it took some time for the idea to penetrate. Wakefield
quotes Tac. Ann. iii. 4 ‘nihil tamen Tiberium magis penetravit
quam studia hominum accensa in Agrippinam ⁷, but this is not
parallel use, for here penetravz't=vexavz't. For the use of the
impersonal verb see the note on l. 795.

1264. Munro: ‘and could by hammering out be brought to
tapering points of any degree of sharpness and fineness ².

prorsum, ‘absolutely‚' ‘ perfectly‚' is less commonly used than
the form prorsus.
quamvis, ‘ as far as one could wish.'
