LUCRETIUS V. 101 1-29

though a large dose would be fatal, a doctor could use a poison in
smaller quantities with good effects. But this is not so pointed and
involves a further departure from the MSS.

1011. See the notes on ll. 953, 955.

pellis=sp0lia ferarum ; see l. 954.

1012. The beginnings of the formation of the family. Munro
supplied the italicized line to complete the sense, which was defective
owing to the loss of a verse.

lecti socialia iura, ‘the ties and laws of wedlock.'
1015. curavit ut=effecit ut.
alsia, ‘cold,’ once in Lucretius, twice in Cicero: the word is
connected with algeo, alsi.
ignis: see l. 953. Darwin says the discovery of fire was
probably the greatest man ever made, excepting that of language.
loli-6. Contrast this with the hardier habits of 1. 970—2, ‘no longer
as be ore.‘

1017-8. Children began to take freer liberties with their parents.

1019. amicitiem: for amicitiam. 1. 1047 notities, l. 1267 ma-
teriem ; iii. 59 avarities. This is the beginning of the social
contract of mutual advantage between men.

1021. commendarunt, ‘ claimed indulgence for.’

muliebreque: see note on esseque, l. 874.

1022. balbe: with hasting, stammering speech.

1023. misererier: see note on molirier, 1. 934.

1024. omnimodis. Cf. ‘multimodis (multi' modis), mirimodis
(miri’ modis) ’ : so this should be omm'bumodis.

1025. bona magnaque pars: so in Ter. Eun. i. 2. 43 ‘bonam
magnamque partem! Duff compares ‘pleno bene,’ l. 708.

caste = inviolata.

1026. aut = εἰ δέ μή, 6οῖῑι(>,ι”ινίεε·.’

1027. Cf. ll. 850, 856.

1028. There is a good description os the early life of mankind in
Hor. Sat. i. 3. 99—111:

‘ cum prorepserunt primis animalia terris,
mutum et turpe pecus, glandem atque cubilia propter
unguibus et pugnis, dein fustibus, atque ita porro
pugnabant armis quae post fabricaverat usus,
donec verba quibus voces sensusque notarent
nominaque invenere : dehinc absistere bello,
oppida coeperunt munire et ponere leges,
ne quis fur esset, neu latro, neu quis adulter.

iura inventa metu iniusti fateare necesse est.’

1029. expressit = emittere coegit, ‘wrested,' ‘ elicited.’ Lucretius
holds the view that the names were given gradually by a natural
instinct and desire on the part of the individual to express his
wishes and feelings. Contrast with this view the account given in
Genesis, where the story says that all animals were brought to
Adam and he gave each one its name.
