earliest days, and would have been sar more surprised if one day
the sun had never set at all.

977. a parvis=a primis annis.

979. Notice how Lucretius piles up his verbs to emphasize the
impossibility of the view. In vi. 727 he actually has ‘fit uti fiat ’.

mirarier: see molirier 1. 934.

981. detracto : as if the disappearance of the sun had been caused
by some evil spirit or by enchantments. Cf. Verg. Ecl. viii. 69

‘ Thessala lunam caelo deripit ’.

982. curae: predicative dative.

983. quietem, ‘repose.’ There is no need to suppose that it is
either ‘time of rest' or ‘ place of rest’: the mere fact that their
vigilance was relaxed often proved fatal to them.

986. intempesta noete, ‘in the dead of night! Verg. Georg. i.
247 ‘intempesta silet nox’3 Aen. iii. 587 ‘nox intempesta ⁸.

‘cum tempus agendi est nullum '.

cedebant, ‘ surrendered.’

987. The savage guests were the uninvited boar and lion.

988. nimio plus: usually ‘too much,’ here, ‘much more,’ a corn-
parative use. In vi. 1196 ⁴ nec nimio post ‘. Plaut. Bacch. i. 2. 14

989. Notice the alliteration of the liquid l. Duff compares
Gray's Elegy, ‘nor cast one longing lingering look behind.'

990. unus quisque, ⁸ one or other.’

magis ε sc. quam mmc.

991. haustus, ‘ rent ⁹ ; cf. note on l. 1324 hauribant: so we have
in 1. 1069 ‘suspensis teneros imitantur dentibus haustus ⁹. See
Lewis and Short‚ haurio, 1. B. 2.

992. i. e. the lairs where they had made their homes, · cf. l. 955

993. Notice the alliteration: the use of v (with a w· s-ound9) was
felt to com ey pathos. Verg. Aen. vi. 833‘ neu patriae validas in
xiscera vertite vires’ For viscera see on l. 903. Munro quotes
Spenser' s Faery Queene 1i.8.16‘but be entornbed m the rav en or

vermina. Fest. p. 37 5, Miill. ‘vermina dicuntur dolores corporis
cum quodam minuto motu quasi a vermibus scindatur. Hic dolor
Graece στρόφος dicitur.’ As στρόφος from στρέφω, so in Latin we
find tormina from torqueo. For the v alliteration see l. 993.
998. vellent, ‘ wanted ' or ‘ needed,’ so as to be healed. Wake-
