LUCRETIUS v. 840—58

nee utrum=nezctrzcm ; nec and ne were the old forms of the
negative3 cf. neglego, nec-lego, not to regard‚ disregard.
840. orba. · more commonly constructed with the ablative. Verg.
Georg. iv. 309 ‘visenda modis animalia miris, trunca pedum primo’.
viduata: also sar more usually constructed with the ablative;

cf. ii. {343‘ corpora secreta teporis’ ; 1. 1041 ‘materies aversa viai’
vicissim: contra.

841. vultu=lumzffmbug oculis. Cf. Verg. A en. xii. 70 ‘figitque in

virgine vultus '. These monstrosities of nature still recur from time
to tlrne.

842. adhaesus is a Lucretian word.

844. quod foret usu.. So in iv. 831 ‘quae foret usus': quadis
accusative of reference (in place of the usual ablative) or else sumere
is understood; Plaut. T rue. ν. 10 ‘puero opus est cibum’. Cato
R. R. 15 ‘ (calcis) opus est unum modium ³. Duff compares 1. 1053
‘quid sit opus facto‚' ‘in respect of what there is need of action. ’

847. cupitum aetatis florem. Cf. iii. 770 ‘cupitum aetatis
tangere florem ’=crescere‚ i. e. they perished before reaching
maturity. So in Greek we find in Pindar ἄωτος ζωᾶς, ‘the flower
or prime of life.’

848. Veneris res, ‘union of love ' or ‘ marriage? The Romans
were fond of using proper names instead of common nouns3 cf.
Ter. Eun. iv. 5. 6 ‘sine Cerere et Libero friget Venus', ‘Love in
a hut with water and a crust,’ Keats. We find the same proverb in
Cic. N. D. ii. 23. 60.

849. All conditions must be favourable to ensure procreation-
eoneurrere, ‘happen at the same time,' ‘meet together.’
debere is the only instance of hypermeter inLucretius z it is not

uncommon in Vergil, but is practicallyiunknown in Greek hexameters.

850. Notice the strong alliteration: in 1. 856 we find a more
emphatic instance still. The first syllable of both the verb and
the subst. propago is variable3 cf. 1. 856.

procudere: i.e. to establish the continuity: the metaphoris
from forging metal‚ ‘ to weld on the anvil of life the links os future
generations.’ Cf. Plaut. Ps. ii. 2. 20 ‘haee mihi incus est: pro-
cudam ego hodie hinc multos dolos’.

855. tum: in the old days when life was a struggle and only the
best fitted survived‚ exactly as modern science teaches us.

11111ῃέ011111111. · all kinds of living creatures.

8 6 C l 8 0

8ξ7. The ol{l pronunciation of the Latin v as the English w
would emphasize the alliteration of such 111105 as these. ‘ Drinking
in the breath of life.‘ Verg. Aen. 1. 546‘ si tescitur aura aetheria'.

858. These three qualities represent the fox, the 11011, and the
deer mentioned in ll. 862-3.

aut denique, ‘ or even '; the adverb implies that this physical
