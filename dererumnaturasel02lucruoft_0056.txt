LUCRETIUS V. 1172-93

1172. tribuebant, ‘attributed’; cf. tribuit, 1. 1195: so tradere,
l. 1187, dabant, l. 1175, and relinquunt, 1. 1239.

1174. pro, ‘to match.'

1176. suppeditabatur, ‘was brought up before thern,‘ ‘rose up
before their eyes.’

manebat, ‘ appeared unchanged '3 cf. l. 830 ‘manet sui similis
res ’. Theresore men imagined that these divinities were immutable
and immortal.

1177. et tamen: see note on 1. 1096; with omnino, ‘and yet
without all this? With auctos understand deos.

1178. temere, ‘ lightly ' or ‘easily ’.

convinci. Munro says Lucretius often uses vinco for convinco:
to this use of convinci for vinci there is no parallel case. Duff
quotes Shakespeare, Alacbetlz, i. 7. 64, ‘his two chamberlains Will l
with wine and wassail so convince‚’ i.e. overcome.

1 179. fortunis: they believed that the happiness of the gods far
exceeded their own.

1180. vexaret: subjunctive, as expressing their thought, not ne-
cessarily the true reason, a semi-sneer on the part of Lucretius
at the credulity of these god-worshippers.

1182. inde z i.e. ‘ab operibus suis '.

1183. caeli rationem ‘the system of the heavens‚’ i. e. the series
or cycle of natural phenomena, e.g. tempora, ‘the seasons,’ the
waning and waxing of the moon, &a

1185. Compare Vergil's line that refers to Lucretius, Georg. ii.
490 ‘felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas ’.

1186. ‘And so they considered it to be their last resource to
alitzibm‘ilffoerything to the gods and to make everything subject to
t eir w¹ .

perfugium, a complementary accusative to tradere et facere,
infinitives to be treated as nouns.

1188. templa: here used in the older sense of ‘realms’ or
‘quarters of the sky', as it is in ll. 1205, 1436, and in i.
1014 ‘caeli lucida templa’. Epicurus maintained that the gods
lived not in the sky but in the spaces between the worlds, μετα-
ΚΟσ la.

1389. sol: a reading suggested for MS. nox which occurs again
in t e next line.

1190. The substantives in this line and the next are subjects
to volvi videtur. Notice the repetition of luna.

signa severa, ‘the still, eold star5,’ ‘the austere stars ⁹: l. 1210
‘ candida sidera ’.

1191. faces, ‘meteors': ii. 206 ‘nocturnasque faces ’. Vergil
describes them well in Georg. i. 367 ‘(videbis) flammarum
longos a tergo albescere tractus '. N otice the repetition flammae-
que volantes, ‘fiery comets.’

1192. A remarkable case of asyndeton ; cf. 11. 1372, 1448—9.

1193. Notice the force given by the m alliteration as the
culmination of the catalogue of phenomena, ‘the terrors of the
threatening thunderbolt'3 cf. l. 1221.
