LUCRETIUS V. 1 131-51

1131. proinde: dissyllabic as in 1. 1041.
sine: addressing each reader individually.
sanguine sudent: see Lewis and Short, sudo, Ι. A. β; Luke
xxii. 44; Hesiod, Op. 289 τῆς δ’ ἀρετῆς ἱδρῶτα θεοὶ προπάροιθεν
ἔθηκαν ἀθάνατοι· μακρὸς δέ καὶ ὄρθιος· οἶμος ἐς αὐτὴν καὶ τρηχύς. Duff
quotes the French proverb ‘suer sang et eau’, to exert oneself
excessively.

1133. Men are too ready to follow the majority and go with the
stream of public opinion: also they do not trouble to think for
themselves, and so the faculties gradually become weaker and more
rudimentary from disuse. Duff adds Hor. Ep. i. 16. 19 ‘vereor ne
cui de te plus quam tibi credas ’-

1135. ‘ And this is no more good at the present time nor will it
be in the future . . .’

1136. The Nemesis and invidia of l. 1126 fell on the kings of
old times. N otice participle and adjective to maiestas.

1137. soliorum: an unusual plural attracted probably by the
number of sceptra, which in the abstract sense is generally used in
the plural ; see on l. 1234.

1 138. ‘ The glorious badge of the sovereign head,’ i. e. the crown.

insigne is a substantive.

cruentum must be taken with sub pedibus lugebat.

1140. conculcatur. Cs.11. 1234—5.

metutum: the only instance of the passive of metuo, with
the exception of metuendus. Juvenal gives a lurid picture of the
malevolence of the mob in Sat. x. 66 ‘ Seianus ducitur unco
spectandus: gaudent omnes. “quae labra, quis illi vultus erat.
numquam amavi hunc hominem '' ’.

1141. res: either (1) ‘things came at length into complete ruin
and confusion ’‚ ad summam faecem turbasque, ‘to the lees of
the utmost disorder‚' or (2) = summa res, ‘the sovereign power
passed into the hands of the lowest of the mob’ where ad sum-
mam faecem turbasque means ‘to the mere dregs of the people
and to mob-rule.'

redibat is probably emphatic, returned, went back to the
disorder of the earliest times previous to the government of kings.

1142. summatum, ἅπ. λεγ.ε.ηιηιυηιηῑ imperium. Cf. auxilia-
tum, l. 1040.

1143. From partim we get the subject to docuere, as in 1. 1310.
Compare the development of the power of the plebs in the early
history of Rome.

1144. constituere is of course the perfect.

1145. defessum: common with infinitive in Plautus, as lassus
with the same construction in Propertius.

1149. aequis: emphatic, legal t. t. ‘equity,' or case-law, where
the circumstances of the case are taken into consideration.

1150. pertaesum : more common with the genitive than with the
infinitive.

1 151. inde: from the punishment that is now meted out to those
avengers who take the law into their own hands.
