LUCRETIUS V. 1069-85

omnia: sc. loca.

1069. ‘ pretend to bite them gently with lightly closing jaws.’
Munro seems to put it rather too strongly: ‘a seint of swallowing
them) For haustus see note on 1. 991. Munro quotes a passage,
‘ nec blandis mihi morsibus renides,' from an epigram on a pet dog,
Myia, written perhaps in the first century A.D., and found at Agen
a Auch in South France ε apparently it is in imitation of Catull. iii.

1070. alio pacto=alia ratione3 cf. 1. 1281; it is common through-
out Latin.

gannitu, ‘ yelping.’

adulant: rarer than adulantur, ‘caress‚’ literally, ‘fawn on.’
1071. et eum: as above, l. 1066.

baubantur, ‘bay,’ ἇπ. λεγ.
1072. plorantes, ‘ whining' or ‘howling.’

summisso corpore, ‘ crouching,' with the tail between the legs.

1074. iuvencus: the adjective is rare in this use: the word is
more common as a substantive or with bos understood. It is also
used of young men and maidens.

1075. pinnigeri. Cf. 1. 737 ‘Veneris praenuntius ante pennatus

raditur .
g calcaribus amoris: so we have in Verg. Georg. iii. 209 ⁴ sed non
ulla magis vires industria firmat quam Venerem et caeci stimulos
avertere amoris, sive boum sive est cui gratior usus equorum '.

1076. ‘he snorts out the alarrn ’ z ad arma, aux amnes, this is
the cry of the sentinel warning his comrades, here of the horse
snorting to attract his mate.

1077. sie alias=at any chance time.

concussis artubus: his limbs pulsing and quivering with life.

1078. Notice the redundancy of expression.

1079. oasin-agae, ‘ osprey,’ which is itself derived from the Latin.
Again the phraseology is tautological, marinis fluctibus in salso
victum vitamque, asin l. 1105. salsum is here a noun. Duff com-
pares in tranquillo, used as a substantive, l. 12.

1081. iaciunt=mittere‚ 1. 1029. Duffs theory that some line, as
‘ et cum progeniem parvam nidosque revisunt ⁹, cf. Verg. Georg. i.
414 ‘ iuvat progeniem parvam dulcesque revisere nidos,' has dropped
out, is not only improbable owing to the double et cum in different
senses so close together, but also absolutely unnecessary, for
Lucretius says birds frequently utter eries quite distinct from those
that they make when fighting over their prey: there is no need to
add another point of differenee.

1082. praedaeque . . ., ‘struggle with their prey’: if praeda is
read, it is governed by de.

1083. tempestatibus, ⁴ along with the changes of weather.’
Take una with cum ε for the inversion cf. 1. 1228.

1084. cornicum ut saecla vetusta: crows, rooks, and ravens
are said to be long-lived.

1085. This superstitition is mentioned in Verg. Gcm‘g. i. 388
‘ cornix plena pluviam vocat improba voce ’. Notice the redundancy
of expression in 1. 1086.
