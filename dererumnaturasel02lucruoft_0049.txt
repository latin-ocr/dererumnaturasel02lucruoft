LUCRETIUS V. 1 030-47

1030. ‘ In a very similar way inability to speak is in its turn seen

to prompt infants to point and to beckon.'
infantia: Hor. Sat. ii. 5. 39 ⁴ seu rubra Canicula findet infantes
statuas ¹, ‘ statues that cannot speak.'

1032. cum facit, ut, ‘ when it causes thern to.’

sint: the subjunctive is possibly due to the feeling in Lucretius'
mind that their reason for pointing is their wish to ask some
question about the object : sint then is an indirect question.

1033. vis: for viris as in ii. 586, iii. 266.

vis : to be taken either (1) with sentit, ‘ as to his powers each
man feels . . .’; this is probably the correct way of taking the
passage, owing to the position of quisque between vis and suas, as
it would be distinctly awkward to extract quisque from its enclosed
place and to separate it from the two words that confine it ; or (2)
with abuti, which in Plaut. and Terence frequently governs the
accusat. So we have in 1. 358 ‘ neque fungitur hilum '. Of abutor
Duff says = ἀποχρῆσθαι here, often = καταχρῆσθαι.

quoad is scanned by synizesis as one long syllable3 cf. ll. 1213,
1433·

1034. vitulo: dative of possessor.

1035. illis: i.e. cornibus. Hor. Od. iii. 13. 3 ‘haed0, cui frons
turgida cornibus primis et Venerem et proelia destinat. ’

inurget: a rare word, ‘pushes’ or ‘ubutts Hor. Sat ii. 1. 52
‘dente lupus, cornu taurus petit'‚ and Verg. Ecl. iii. 87 ‘(taurus)
cornu petat’. Wakefield adds 'Ov. Hal. ‘vitulus sic nempe
minatur qui nondum gerit in tenera iam* cornua fronte3 sic
dammae fugiunt, pugnant virtute leones, et morsu canis, et caudae
sic scorpios ictu ’. That is, in all animals we find that instinct
causes them to act in the way natural to their kind, even before
they have been taught by actual experience: this is worked out in
the next few lines.

1036. scymni: a word characteristically chosen by Lucretius as
being parallel to catuli.

iam tum, ‘even at this early age.’

1040. tremulum well expresses the uncertain efforts of half-
fledged birds in their earliest attempts at flight.

auxiliatum : ἄπ. λεγ. = auxilium. Cf. summatum, 1. 1142.

1041. proinde: dissyllabic, ‘ and so.'

aliquem, ‘one distinct person!

inde refers back to the aliquem, ‘and it was from him men
learned’ t cf. the use of inde, l. 1093.

putare is subject to est.

1045. Munro compares the same phrase in ll. 756, 765. In full
it is equivalent to tamen tempore eodem : the phrase is to be taken
with putentur.

non quisse (— - quz'vz'sse): for nequivisse.

1047. fuerant: the pluperfect of the auxiliary marks a very
strong pluperfect time.

notities: see note on αιιιι’σιίι’,ενιι l. 1019. This is a poetical,
though not a strictly accurate translation of Epicurus' πρόληψις,
