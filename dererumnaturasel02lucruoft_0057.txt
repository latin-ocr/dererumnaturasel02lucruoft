LUCRETIUS V. 1194-1209

1194. genus: probably the exclamatory accusative. Duff corn-
pares ii. 14 ‘o miseras hominum mentes ἱ ’

1195. tribuit: as in 1. 1172.

iras : men in their folly assigned human passions to the godS‚
though, as Munro says, “‘neque tangitur ira” was an essential
of the divine nature according to Epicurus and Lucretius ’. So
Verg. Aen. i. 11 ‘tantaene animis caelestibus irae?'
1198. pietas, ‘no act of piety is it to be often seen.’
velatum : the Romans prayed velato capite, the Greeks aperto
ca ite.

{199- vertier ε see note on 1. 934. Munro : ‘ the suppliant
approached in such a way as to have the statue of the god on his
right and then aster praying wheeled to the right so as to front it,
and then prostrated himself: προσκυνεῖν περιφερομένους.’

ad lapidem : either (1) contemptuously on the partos Lucretius,
‘ a mere stone,’ ‘the work of rnen’s hands‚’ or possibly a diorite or
meteoric stone, or (2) one of the busts of Janus or perhaps one of the
termini (boundary stones) which were held sacred by the Romans.

1200. N otice the strong p alliteration.

pandere palmas: i.e. with the palms uppermost as in Verg.
Aen. iv. 205 ‘multa Iovem manibus supplex orasse supinis ’,and in
Aesch. P. V. 1005 λιπαρεῖν ὑπτιάσμασιν χερῶν.

1202. votis nectere vota : either (1) to reel off one prayer after
another as a selfish man might do, making no end to his wishes as
in Pers. Sat. v. 53 ‘ nec voto vivitur uno '‚ or (2) as the rows of votive
tablets which were hung up on the walls of the temples in return sor
blessings already vouchsafed and setting forth petitions still to be
granted, votivae tabulae.

1203, sed mage, ‘but rather‚’ an apocop. form of magis, being
originally magi’, then magi, finally changing to mage as pote of potis
in iii. 1079. An untroubled conscience is the possession of the really
good man.

1205. templa: as in ll. 1188, 1436.

fixum: for the fixity of the sky we may compare 1. 511 ‘ex
utraque polum parti premere aera nobis dicendum est extraque
tenere et claudere utrimque ’, and for its revolution i. 2 ‘caeli subter
labentia signa ’, and Ov. Met. ii. 204 ‘ altoque sub aethere fixis
incursant stellis' ; the two ideas should be combined, i. e. the
revolution of the sky on a fixed axis.

1206. Notice this impersonal construction with a genitive pro-
bably on the analogy of the genitive after verbs such as reminiscor:
this construction is common in Cicero, see Lewis and Short, mens,
11. B. The more usual construction is the personal subject.

1207. oppressa ε to be taken with pectora.

1208. expergefactum eaput erigere: i. e. ‘se expergefacere et
consurgere atque intrare pectora nostra ².

1209. nobis: ethic dative, ‘ we may find to our cost’ ; cf. l. 805.

immensa: in its primary sense, ‘boundless.' This is one of
the lines which seem to shadow certain misgivings in the mind os
Lucretius about the power of the gods 3 cf. ll. 1156—7.
