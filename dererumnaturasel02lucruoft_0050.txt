LUCRETIUS V. 1048-66

which is preconception based on knowledge gained from former
experiences3 see the Introduction, ‘Philosophy of Epicurus.’ Cf.
l. 182 ‘notities divis hominum unde est insita primum, quid vellent
facere ut scirent animoque viderent?’ i.e. what pattern sor the
creation of man could be present in the minds of the gods to enable
them to realize what was their real object and wish? for if they
had no preconceived idea of man, they could have no pattern
to follow in their work of creation. So too if man had no pre—
conception of voice he never either could or would have used it.

1048. huie: i.e. the aliquem of l. 1041.

1049. See note on 1047. Notice sciret lengthened by the
emphatic beat: so in English poetry‚ especially in the hymns we
have frequent instances of syllables usually short being lengthened
by the beat. The only other example in Lucretius is ‘fulget ’ ii. 27.

1050. eogere . . . victosque domare: see on 1. 792.

1052. suadereque: see on esseque, l. 874. Successsul efforts
have recently been made, especially in America, to teach those who
are both deas and blind to talk.

105 ὃν, quid sit opus facto: facto depends on epm, which takes
the a lative.

quid is an accusat. of reference. See note on l. 844. In
Terence Ad. iii. 4. 65 ‘moneo quid facto opus sit ‘. Plaut. T rue.
v. 10 ‘opus est cibum '.

1054. amplius, ‘further‚ longer, too long‚’ so ‘continually.’

1057. vigeret: subjunctive after eui = quippe cui, Duff.

1058. pro vario sensu, ‘according to their different emotions,'
pleasure‚ grief or fear, &c. ; cf. 1. 1061 and note on l. 1063.

1059. mutae ; of inarticulate sounds, see note on 1. 1088.

denique, ‘ actually!

1061. gliscunt: literally ⁵ swell,’ i.e. their hearts swell with joy or
passion (dolor, ‘resentment '); cf. iv. 1069 ‘ inque dies gliscit
furor ’.

1062. quippe etenim: so in l. 1169 a redundant expression =
‘fon’

rebu- apertis, ‘from plain ’ or ‘obvious facts.’ So in iv. 467.
‘ nam nil aegrius est quarn res secernere apertas ab dubiis ⁹.

1063. Munro quotes Darwin ε ‘the dog since being domesticated
has learnt to bark in at least four or five distinct tones.' Molossi
(canes is often omitted) were a famous breed of large dogs cele-
brated throughout all Latin literature.

1064. mollia ricta, ‘ spongy open lips.’

ricta: an irregular plural from collateral form rictum as in vi.
1195. Observe the number of adjectives without connecting par-
tic1253 asyndeton is very common in Lucretius; cf. ll. 948, 1096,
143 .

1065. restricta: bare or show their teeth, as in Quint. Decl. xii.
27 ‘ restrictis labris ¹.

1066. et cum, ‘than when . . . ' so again in ll. 1067, 1071, 1077.
After alius, ac or fitque is more common than εἰς 500 note on l. 1260.

iam, ‘outrig qt.
