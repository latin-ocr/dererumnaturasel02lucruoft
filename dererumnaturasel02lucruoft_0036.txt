NOTES

783. principio, ‘at the beginning of the world.’ The account
of the creation of the world in the first chapter of Genesis may be
compared with this passage. The straightforward simplicity os
both accounts and the harmony of the biblical and pagan narratives
are remarkable. The early philosophers agreed that primarily all
living things sprang from the earth. Similar descriptions of the
creation are found at the beginning of the first book of Ovid’s
Alelamorplzoses and in Hesiod's W orks and Days.

786. arboribus. Wakefield quotes Empedocles’ theory that
herbage was created first, πρῶτα τῶν ζῴων τὰ δένδρα ἐκ γῆς ἀναδῦναι.
certamen is the subject to datumst.

787. magnum certamen, ‘ a keen rivalry.’

immissis habenis, ‘in unchecked profusion’: a somewhat
incongruous metaphor for the riotous luxuriance of thick jungle
growth. Vergil, however, has no hesitation in using the phrase in
a similar context, where he describes the vine shoot as growing
freely ε Georg. ii. 364 ‘ palmes se agit laxis immissus habenis ’.

788. primum. Munro says that as birds have rudiments of
feathers and animals have hair at birth and before they show any
activity in life, so the earth at creation had herbage before it
produced animate beings : Ov. Met. i. 44 ‘iussit fronde tegi silvas ’-

789. pennipotentum: a word coined by Lucretius, found only
here and in ii. 878.

791. inde loci: so too inl. 443; cf. l. 807 ubi loci, a partitive
genitive 3 cf. postea loci, ‘afterwards'

mortalia saecla, ‘ all living creatures‚' the generations of living
creatures that must die.

792. multa modis multis. Notice the alliteration; see Intro-
duction, The Style of Lucretius. Observe that Lucretius has no
objection to the repetition of meaning in different words ; cf. l. 801,
l. 1002 ‘temere incassum frustra ³, 1. 1050. Here modis mullis:
varia ratione.

793. de eaelo. Cf. ii. 1153 ‘haud mortalia saecla superne aurea
de caelo demisit funis in arva’: the Stoics maintaining that life
came from heaven let down by a golden cord. Lucretius denies
that the gods had any interest or share in the creation of the
world.

794. de salsis lacunis=mare3 cf. ii. 1155 ‘nec mare nec fluctus
plangentes saxa crearunt, sed genuit tellus eadem quae nunc alit ex
se’: Lucretius says that lise could not be generated in the first
instance in the sea, but required the warnith and nurturing care of
mother earth.

795. linquitur. We find this impersonal use of linquitur with ut
