LUCRETIUS V. 797-81 7

and the subj. in ii. 914. Lucretius uses impersonal verbs frequently,
convenit, penetrabat, superest, sequitur. Out of the four elements
Lucretius has dismissed the claims of fite, air, and water to be the
creative power, therefore earth alone remains as the universal mother.

797. exsistunt. ε exoriuntur: it is usually constructed with ex or
ab, and not with the simple ablative as here.

798. concreta, ‘are moulded into shape '; so l. 1257. In
l. 1116 we have the uncompounded verb creti. So in Cic. Tusc. v.
24. 69 ‘ initia unde essent omnia orta, generata, concreta ’.

799. minus with mirum, not with quo.

800. nova: when the productive powers os the earth were still
vigorous 3 cf. 1. 907 ‘tellure nova caeloque recenti ’.

adulta is in agreement with plura.

801. alituum. This form of the genit. plur. of ales, which is con-
venient sor scansion, is found not only in Lucretius but also in Verg-
Aen. viii. 27 and other poets.

variae=l. 825 ‘ volucris variantibu' formis ¹.

802. ova relinquebant exclusae : i. e. were hatched. Ov. Asel.
i. 75 ‘ cepit volucris agitabilis aer’. Cicero uses excludere frequently
in this sense. Verg. Georg. ii. 338 ‘ ver illud erat . . . et hibernis
parcebant flatibus Euri, cum primae lucem pecudes hausere‚' where
the sense is the same.

803. folliculos: little leathern bags, here ‘eggs ³. Duff compares
iv. 58 ‘ teretes ponunt tunicas aestate cicadae’.

805. tibi = τοι, ‘ let me tell you ‘ ; ethic dative z cf. l. 1209
nobis.

mortalia saecla, ⁴ races of men,' but see l. 791.

806. calor atque umor are the two great essentials of productiori
and growth.

807. hoc, ‘therefore.'

ubi loci: see l. 791.

808. terram apti, ‘ embracing‚’ ‘ clinging to,' from apiscor.
Plaut. Capt. iv. 1. 8 ‘ hereditatem sum aptus ⁸.

809. aetas: the age of the growing infant. MSS. have aestas, the
warmth of the growing child. Others read aestus, the restless
movements of the infants and the resulting heat.

810. petessens ε an old desiderative form : note the transference
of fugiens and petessens to aetas from infantum, to which the two
participles properly belong.

81 1. ibi: for illic, i. e. ad uteros, ‘turned the pores of the earth in
that direction,' causing the flow of nutriment to the necessary places.

812. cogebat: the object is foramina: sucum is the objectos
fundere.

813. consimilem : with genitive : so too in 1. 714; more usually
it is constructed with the dative.

815. impetus ille alimenti, ‘that stream,’ or ‘rush of 1101111511-
ment‚’ which served to seed the child while still unborn.

816. vapor : the temperate warmth of the earth in the early days
rendering clothing unnecessary ; cf. ll. 818-9.

817. lanugine is the soft, velvety growth of luxuriant grass.
