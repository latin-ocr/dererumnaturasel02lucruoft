INTRODUCTION

*THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS

THE life of Lucretius, as it is usually accepted, is given here
without any examination of the conflicting accounts and theories
put forward by different editors.

Titus Lucretius Carus was born probably B.c. 99 and died
October 15, B.C. 55. The statement that his death was due to
suicide during madness brought on by drugs must be viewed with
suspicion. He was a man of good family. He had literary tastes
and showed no inclination sor a political life, more especially during

He lived the life of a student and devoted himself to the philosophy
of Epicurus: the result of his lifework is the presentation of that
philosophy in the didactic poem De Rerum Natura in six books,

language and turn of expression strongly. He is fond of using old
and half-forgotten forms of words : he uses and invents compound
adjectives of a Greek type, such as vulgz'vagzcs, levz'sommcs, angui-
manus, penm'polens, bucerus: alliteration and assonance, a charac-
teristic feature in the early period of the literature of any nation,
play a prominent part, especially where the poet wishes to drive a
point horne.

The Lucretian hexameter is distinctly in advance of that of
Ennius, yet it is closer to the rugged verse os the older poet than to
the smoothness and elaboration of the Vergilian line. He is ready
to use spondaic endings‚ archaic terminations of substantives and
verbs: he makes free use of elision and frequently marks off the
