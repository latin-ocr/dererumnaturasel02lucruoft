LUCRETIUS V. 999-1010

field mentions Bentley’s citation of Sil. It. xi. 166 ‘medicinam
vulnera poscunt ’.

999. at: marking a strongly contrasted thought leading off from
the preceding idea. Perhaps Lucretius is thinking of the blood-
shed of the civil wars during his early life.

1000. In l. 95 we have ‘una dies dabit exitio '. So in Enn. Ann.
8 ‘ (milia) multa dies in bello conficit unus ’.

1001. We have a picture of the reckless greed of merchants in
Hor. Od. i. 1. 17 ‘(mercat0r) mox reficit rates quassas, indocilis
pauperiem pati '.

lidebant, ‘dashed’ ; the verb lida is found here only, but it is
frequent in compounds allido, collido, illido.

1002. hio=tum.

temere ineassum frustra, ‘without aim, purpose, or result.’
These three adverbs occur in ii. 1060 and are practically synony-
mous: see note on multa modis multis, l. 792.
1003. saevibat: see note on scibat, l. 934.
ponebat=deponebat.
inanis : to be taken predicatively.

1004. Notice the strong alliteration and also the repetition of
pellacia, pellicere for the sake of emphasis. The sentiment is
similar in ii. 559 ‘subdola curn ridet placidi pellacia ponti ’‚ but
without any idea of treachery in i. 8 ‘tibi rident aequora ponti ’.

1005. in fraudem, ‘to his ruin.'

1006. ‘When reckless seacraft was still a locked mystery to the
ships,’ as in the days before shipbuilding described in Ov. Mel. i.
94 ‘nondum caesa suis peregrinum ut viseret orbem montibus in
liquidas pinus descenderat undas, nullaque mortales praeter sua

litora norant‚' when men did not travel beyond their immediate
neighbourhood.

1007. tum deinde‚‘ it was then too that.

penuria= inepta, σπάνις.

1008. mersat: the objectis hommes understood. Munro seems
to take me7sat as if it were intransitive: ‘sinks into ruin.’ The
meaning is that men dig their graves with their teeth, greater
numbers dying from overeating than from want of food.

1009. Men used in their ignorance the juice of poisonous berries
as a drink or possibly as a medicine. Duff quotes Verg. Gemg.
ii. 152 ⁴ nec miseros fallunt aconita legentes '.

1010. vergebant, ‘poured out for themselves': so in Stat. Theb.
vi. 211 ‘ spumantesque mero paterae verguntur? vmgere means to
tilt the vessel so as to pour out the contents.

nuno dant aliis: a correction for the MS. reading nudant.
Munro suggested ‘nurui nunc dant’: ‘now with nicer skill men
give it to their son’s wife instead‚' i. e. to obtain her dowry. He
quotes in support of his emendation Juv. xiv. 220 ‘elatam iam
crede nurum, si limina vestra mortifera cum dote subit! A passage
might also be added from Ov. llset. i. 147 ‘lurida terribiles miscent
aconita novercae’ Palmer proposed‘ medici nunc dant. .usi :
‘now doctors prescribe and administer it,’ with the meaning that
