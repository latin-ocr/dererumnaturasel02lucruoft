INTRODUCTION

by the gods, who were in reality indifferent to the affairs of man-
kind and had no inducement to exchange their leisured happiness
sor the anxiety of world-making. Surely too, if the gods had made
the world, it would have been both better and happier. To
Lucretius Nature was the real creative power. The world and
all that is in it is mortal; water, air, fire, stones‚ ether itself, all
gradually decay and die away. Earth had its beginning and must
have its end. He then goes on to describe the formation of the
world out of indestructible atoms which collided and combined:
the heavier particles forming the earth, the lighter ones composing
the ether and the heavenly bodies, and so the earth sank and the
ether rose. Next‚ he endeavours to describe the motions and
courses of the stars and to explain the nature of the sun, which
he with the Epicureans maintained was really of the size that it
appeared to thern. After this follows a description of the recurrence
of days and nights‚ of the succession of the seasons, and an explana-
tion of the causes of eclipses.

At this point our selection opens with the story of the creation of
herbage, animals‚ birds, and lastly man produced from earth, the
all-mother. Lucretius denies the possibility of beings of twofold
nature, such as Centaurs‚ Satyrs, Scylla and the like. Then
follows an account of the earliest life of man, the beginnings of
social intercourse, the discovery os fire and the development of
civilization. And now Lucretius launches out into a bitter indict-
ment of religion and describes its evil effects on man. Next he
tells of the discovery of the use of metals‚ the consequent develop-
ment of war and its instruments, the cultivation of the soil, the
beginnings of music, and the observance of the recurring seasons.
Naturally resulting from these arts come the closer life and
communion of man with man, the discovery of letters, the
beginnings of history, and the progress of the arts and luxuries
of life up to the elaborate civilization of his own day.
