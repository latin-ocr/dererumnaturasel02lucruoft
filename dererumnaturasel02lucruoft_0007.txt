PREFACE

Tffls edition has been prepared in the hope that with its
help some of the finest and most vivid Latin poetry that sur-
vives may in the future be read in lower forms than has been
hitherto usual.

There is a natural objection to reading part of a poem or
to beginning in the middle of a book, and it is hoped that an
edition which omits the preceding eight hundred lines, a long
and difficult passage with no particular connexion with this
selecfion, and which so presents a subject of more reasonable
length for a middle form, will virtually if not actually remove
such hesitation.

Though a selection‚ it is totus teres atque rotundus and
forms a complete epic in itself. Lucretius is generally con-
sidered to be a difficult author and is reserved for the higher
forms, but it is believed that this selection will, with the aid of
the notes, be found to present little difficulty to the average
boy, and it will certainly give him an intensely graphic picture
of the development of civilization as conceived by the most
imaginative genius among Latin writers. Every edition of
Lucretius is based on Munro's great work, and this one owes
much to Mr. Duff’s admirable edition. I also offer my sincere
thanks to the reader of the Clarendon Press for many instances
of suggestive advice. The text of the Clarendon Press has

been followed practically throughout.
