LUCRETIUS V. 1332-51

1332. ab nervis succisa, ‘hamstrung‚’ used of men or horses.
ab nervis=a parte nervorum.

1333. concidere . . . : Verg. Aen. v. 447 ‘ ipse gravis graviterque
ad terram pondere vasto concidit’, of the crashing fall os the
mighty boxer Entellus.

1334. ante: adverbial, to be taken with putabant. For the
assonance of domi domitos cf. the quotation from Vergil on
1. 1333. In 1. 392 we have ‘ certamine . . . cernere certant ⁹, ii. 539
‘ penitus penetrari '‚ iii. 753 ‘fera saecla ferarum ’.

1336. Notice the emphatic asyndeton as in ll. 1192, 1372, 1448—9.

1337. reducere: scanned as redducere 3 cf. 7'elltgz'0 and relliquiae
sor the sake of metre.

1339. male mactae. Munro takes mactae as a past participle of
an obsolete mace're; cf. permacere. Ennius has‘ permaceat paries’;
cf. macellum. Others hold it to be a syncopated form of mactatus
from macto. Duff distinguishes it clearly from the participle of the
obsolete mergare, found in the phrase ‘ macte virtute', well done.

1340. fera facta: the object of dedere ; cf. 1. 1329.

1341—6. MSS. have six lines which Munro considers spurious.
-Duff says ‘ they are clearly a collection of tags from other parts of
the poem, interpolated by some ignorant copyist '. Others retain
the first three lines and reject the three following.

si<c> fuit ut facerent: sed vix adducor ut, ante

quam commune malurn fieret foedumque, futurum

non quierint animo praesentire atque videre.

et magis id possis facturn contendere in omni

in variis mundis varia ratione creatis (as in l. 528)

quam certo atque uno terrarum quolibet orbi.
The general meaning is ⁴ such was their conduct : yet 1 can
scarcely believe that they would not be able to foresee and forecast
the probable disaster even before it actually happened. And one
would find it easier to imagine it happening under general circum-
stances anywhere in the universe rather than in any particular
world,’ the idea being that if a phenomenon is uncommon some—
where it must be common somewhere else in order to preserve the
equilibrium (ἰσονομία). ·

1347. voluerunt : the subject is the whole of l. 1349.

1348. ipsique perire, ‘though they themselves should perish ' ε
they did not wish to die. Duffquotes Thuc. iii. 40 οἱ μὴ ξὺν προφάσει
τινὰ κακῶς ποιοῦντες ἐπεξέρχονται καὶ διόλλυνται, i. e. attack their foes
at the cost of their own lives.

1350. nem‘lis: i.e. ofskins tied together, and still earlier of plaited
reeds or long leaves.

1351. tela, ‘ the web‚’ the threads of which were fastened vertically
to the yarnbeam (scapi) below and above to the iugum and
separated alternately by the heddles (insilia), of which there
were two, so as to leave a diamond-shaped space through which
the shuttles (radii) passed horizontally: the spindles (fusi) held
the thread. See cut on p. 60. γ

levia, ‘ polished.’
