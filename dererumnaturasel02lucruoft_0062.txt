LUCRETIUS V. 1314-31

1314. turbabant τ the subject is leones understood from l. 1310.

1315. These were not the manes and crests of the wild beasts,
but were artificial and were intended partly to protect the head but
chiefly to inspire terror, as in Liv. xxxvii. 4ο. 4 ‘ingentes ipsi
(elephanti) erant: addebant speciem frontalia et cristae et tergo
impositae turres '. In Vergil we have the natural erest of the lion
mentioned, Aen. xii. 6 ‘ tum demum movet arma leo, gaudetque
comantes excutiens cervice toros ’.

· 1316. fremitu: sc. leonum.

l 1318. irritata: transference of epithet which properly belongs to
eae.
leae is poetical for leaenae.

1319. adversum . . .‚ ‘ would strike in the face these who met
them.’ adversum is an adverb and is to be taken with venienti-
bus, which is dative of the possessor. Duff compares ‘ on lui
trancha la tete ’-

1320. nec opinantis: accusative agreeing with the unexpressed
object of deripiebant, ‘would tear down!

1321. deplexae, ἅπ. λεγ. from deplect0r‚ ‘twining round them-⁹

dabant in terram, ‘ dragged them to the ground ’ ; Liv. xxxi.
37. 9 ‘ rex, ruente saucio equo, praeceps ad terram datus ’.
adfixae = inhaerentes, ‘ fastening on them)

1324. hauribant: for the form see note on scibat, l. 934, for the
meaning see on haustus, 1. 991. Livy uses the same expression in
a similar context vii. 10. 10 ‘uno alteroque ictu ventremvatque
inguina hausit ’.

subter: an adverb, as in 1. 1364, and compare irgfra, 1. 1371,
and circum, ll. 972, 1378, 1437.

1325. terram ruebant, ‘scorecl’ or ‘ploughed up the earth ’, as
in vi. 726 ‘ cum mare permotum ventis ruit intus harenam ἶ. There
is a similar idea in Verg. Ecl. iii. 86 ⁴ pascite taurum, iam cornu
petat et pedibus qui spargat harenam ’.

fronte : i. e. cornu.

1327. This line is followed in the MSS. by a verse in se firaeta
suo tinguentes sanguine tela, which is probably spurious, and was
written as a gloss to explain the word infracta. as equivalent to in
se fracta, ‘broken off short in their bodies‚' for there is also a rare
word infractus, ‘ unbroken.’

d {13293 dabant ruinas, ‘ wrought ruin '; l. 1340 ‘ fera facta

e ere .

1330. transversa, ‘by shying' or ‘swerving to the side would
tr to avoid '.

y exibant, with the accusative, is not uncommon in the sense of
avoiding; so in Verg. Aen. v. 438 ‘ corpore tela modo atque oculis
vigilantibus exit ⁷, and in xi. 750 ‘ vim viribus exit '.

adactus, ‘the thrusts' or ‘gashes'‚ a common meaning of
adzgo, though adactus is ἅπ. λεγ.

1331. iumenta: tame animals, ‘ equi mulique atque asini.’ We
have a similar description of rearing in Verg. Aen. x. 892 ‘tollit se
arrectum quadrupes et calcibus auras verberat ’.
