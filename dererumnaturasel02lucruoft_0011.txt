THE PHILOSOPHY OF EPICURUS

the same nature as the body, though more agile through the
excessive lightness of its composition ; yet it will perish with the
body ancl will have no future existence as it, no less than the more
material and tangible world, has no divine element.

In Ethics Epicurus held the view that pleasure is the sole good
and pain the sole evil: pleasure is the absence of pain. Mental
pleasures are the greater, for bodily pleasures are merely ephemeral.
To ensure freedom from pain he taught the value of plain living,
seeing in virtue not the end of life, but rather the means to the end
of life, which offered to him a state of temperate equilibrium and
pleasant tranquillity‚ both mental and physical (ἀταραξία). So in
Ethics, no less than in Physics, we see that all idea of higher and
inolr? spiritual life is absent, that the divine element is again

THE POEM ‘DE RERUM NATURA’

Lucretius wished to expound the doctrine of Epicurus not merely
from a desire to put before his readers his physical system, but
chiefly from a deeply rooted wish to free mankind from fear of
the gods and from the terrors of death which are caused by the
belief in a future life : he therefore determined to explain the true
nature of things.

Books one and two describe fully the physical theories of Demo-
critus and Epicurus, dwelling on the nature of atoms and void, the
chief component parts of the universe. Book three shows that the
soul is a material part of man and perishes when the body dies:
the next deals with the Epicurean theory of sense. The fifth book
describes the creation of the world, the evolution of man and the
beginnings of society. In the last book Lucretius puts before us
a number of natural phenomena and curiosities in nature, probably

THE SUBJECT-Mssss'lbgl} OF THE FIFTH

The fifth book of Lucretius opens with a panegyric on Epicurus.
The poet then promises a sketch of the creation of the world and of
the heavenly bodies, in order that men realizing the mortal nature
of the world may not be enslaved to the belief that it was created
