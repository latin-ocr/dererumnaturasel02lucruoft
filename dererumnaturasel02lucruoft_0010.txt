INTRODUCTION

first two feet from the rest of the line, interrupting the rhythm by a
sudden jerk. One of the especial features in the verse os Lucretius
is his method of dealing with the fourth foot, which is frequently
contained in a single word and ends with it, while Vergil prefers to
have a caesura. For instance Vergil writes ‘ arma virumque cano
Troiae qui primus ab oris,’ inverting the natural order of Troiae qui:
Lucretius would be content to retain the natural order qui Troiae
and to dispense with the caesura which Vergil prefers to have. So in
our passage Lucretius writes ‘ per totum corpus adhaesu, quod tantis
viribus auctos, nix venti fulmina grando’3 in these lines Vergil
would probably have written ⁶ totum per corpus adhaesu, tantis quod,
vent1 mx.'

The poem leaves on the reader, and still more on the hearer, an
impression of great vigour and freedom of expression untrammelled
by the elaboration considered necessary by the later poets. Mr.
Duff in his introduction aptly quotes the words of Munro: ‘ It has
often struck me that his genius is akin to that of Milton. He dis-
plays a wonderful depth and fervour of thought, expressed in
language of singular force and beauty3 an admirable faculty of
clear, vigorous and well-sustained philosophical reasoning3 and a
style equal in its purity and correctness to that of Terence, Caesar
or Cicero, and superior to that of any writer of the Augustan age.’

Another great asset possessed by Lucretius is the imaginative
insight and exuberant originality by which he pictures to himself
and unfolds to his readers the long periods of the early struggles of
mankind in the dim recesses of the past, until gradually they reached
by the processes of evolution that development of civilization which
culminated in the perfection of his own time (ί ad summum donec
venere cacumen ¹).

Mommsen closes his sketch of Lucretius with this tribute: ‘ The
didactic poem concerning the Nature of Things, however much in
it may challenge censure, has remained one of the most brilliant
stars in the poorly illuminated expanse of Roman literature!

THE PHILOSOPHY OF EPICURUS

Epicurus based his philosophy on the axiom that experience
alone was the foundation-stone of certainty: experience is to be
gained from the impressions of the senses: therefore sensation is
the standard of truth. Moreover, he held that the study of Nature
was desirable in so far as it freed mankind from the trammels of
religion and superstition.

In Physics he denied divine agency in the creation of the world,
maintaining that it was due to the collision and combinations of
immutable and irreducible atoms, and that the meeting of these
atoms was rendered possible by the existence of void. Similarly
the soul itself is composed of the lightest atoms, and is therefore of
