LUCRETIUS V. 859·75

quality is a gift inferior to the two mental qualities. Take est with
tutata.

859. ex ineunte aevo=a primis annis.
h r‘esergans, ⁴ preserve‚’ i.e. keep back for something better
t an deat .

860. Here th'e domestic animals which are mentioned in ll. 864-6
are meant, such as dogs, horses, sheep, and cattle.

862. principio, ‘ in the first place‚’ not as in l. 783.

saecla: sc. animalium not hominum. Verg. Aen. iv. 154

‘ atque agmina cervi pulverulenta fuga glomerant ’.

864. levisomna: ἅπαξ λεγ. Cf. Hor. Od. iii. 16. 2 ‘vigilum canum
tristes excubiae munierant '.

cum has the same force as the simple ablative and this use is

common in Lucretius; cf. l. 904. Duff adds 1. 352 ‘solido cum
corpore '. He mentions also the instance in Homer of the faithful
dog Argos, and remarks that Plato finds in the dog the qualities
proper for the guardians of his ideal State. Republ. ii. 375, 376.

865. veterino: more sully in l. 890 ‘ veterino semine equorum ’,
horses : the word is contracted from vehiterinus from veho, a beast
of burden, rather than a draught-animal.

866. bucera: from the Greek βούκερως; in ii. 663 we have
‘ buceriaeque greges'. Ov. Met. vi. 395 ‘lanigerosque greges
armentaque bucera pavit ’.

867. Memmi. Gaius Memmius was a Roman noble of dis-
tinguished birth: after holding the praetorship he served as
propraetor of Bithynia. It was to this Memmius that Lucretius

dedicated his poem.
868. secuta: in the sense of consequor or pete, it governs pabula

arta.
p 869. suo sine labore : man supplies domestic animals with food
prepared by his own labour in return for the labour and services
performed by them.

871. quis: i. e. animalia quibus.

horum: i.e. no especial qualities to recommend them. The
following lines illustrate Darwin’s theory of the survival of the
fittest.

872. sponte sua. So in ll. 938, 961; originally, ‘of their own
free will,' here, ‘by their own efforts! Plaut. Truc. ii. 6. 45
⁴ nequeo pedibus mea sponte ambulare ‘.

873. quare=quamobrem : practically ablative of the cause.

874. pasci: as βόσκειν of maintaining inferiors or those unable to
help themselves: of animals, slaves, and even of aged parents,
whereas alere=rpid>ew is used in a more complimentary sense.
Hor. Sat. i. 6. 103 ‘ plures calones atque caballi pascendi '; Petron.
57 ‘ viginti ventres pasco et canem ’.

esseque. In Augustam poetry it was very exceptional to
attach que or ve to a word ending in a short e: Lucretius, however,
uses it frequently: l. 1021 muliebreque, l. 1052 suadereque, l. 1289

aetsszztfe'soilioet: scire licet rather than sci (imperative) licet. See
