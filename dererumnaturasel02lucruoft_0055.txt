LUCRETIUS V. 1152-71

1152. i. e. all who commit violence and wrong are likely to find
their evil deeds recoil on their own heads. ⁷

1153. Wakefield quotes Hes. Op. 265 οἷ αὐτῷ κακὰ τεύχει ἀνὴρ
ἄλλῳ κακὰ τεύχων, ἡ δέ κακὴ βουλὴ τῴ βουλεύσαντι κακίστη, i.e. they
fall into pits that they have dug for others : they are hoist with their
own petard.

1156. This is not an inconsistency in Lucretius, who held the
view that the gods entirely disregarded the affairs of mortals: he
means that if a man does believe, whether rightly or wrongly‚ in
the existence of the gods he ought to act on his belief and dread
divine retribution on his misdeeds.

1157. Cf. Psalms xiv. 1 and liii. 1, ‘The fool hath said in his
heart, There is no God.' ‘But,’ says Bacon, ‘he does not believe
it ’ ; he says it merely to encourage himself.

elam : an adverb instead of an adjective, which would be more
usual with fore. Munro : ‘ he cannot but feel a misgiving
that his secret (id) can be kept for ever'. So also in Cic. de Fin.
i. 16. 50 ‘ quamvis occulte fecerit, numquam tamen id confidet fore
semper occultum '.

1158. se : to be taken with protraxe = protraxisse, ‘have given
themselves away.'

protraxe in medium: as in l. 1454 ‘protrahit in medium '.
Compare iv. 1011-14, where Lucretius says that rnen during their
sleep and in their dreams carry out their most deeply cherished
wishes and plans.

1161. numina pervulgarit, ‘ spread abroad the worship of . . .’
Lucretius will now set forth the beginnings of religion.

1163. sollemnia, ‘recurring at stated intervals.’ Notice scicra
followed by sdcrzz; cf. l. 839 ‘interutrasque nec utrum Utrimque’:
so in iv. 1222 ‘quae patribus patres ’ς iv. 1259 ‘ liquidis et liquida ⁹ ;
so Homer has Ἆρες Ἀρες.

1164. This sentence is an adjectival clause.

rebu’, ‘occasions'

1166. suscitat = aedzficat, ¹ raises‚’ i.e. makes men raise.

1167. celebrare, ⁴ to throng them ': so i. 4 ‘ terras concele-
bras '. ·

1168. non ita difficilest: exactly the English idiom, ‘ it is not so
hard 'z on this line depends the construction of the indirect
questions, ll. 1161-3.

1169. quippe etenim: see note on 1. 1062.

1 170. Waking visions or trances,13⁷rap, opposed tol. 1171, dreams
in sleep, ὄναρ. Duff remarks that in ll. 148-9‚ ‘tenvis enirn natura
deum longeque remota sensibus ab nostris animi vix mente videtur,’
Lucretius seems to be inconsistent. But Lucretius means that so
fine is the nature of the matter of which the gods are composed that
the senses of man (sight, hearing) are quite unable to perceive it,
and only the mind, i.e. that part of man which is composed of the
finest atoms, is able to receive any impression of it.

1171. mirando auctu: ablative of quality.

et magis, ‘and still more!

51 D2
