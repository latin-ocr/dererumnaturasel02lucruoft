LUCRETIUS V. 1115-30

of wealth as Ovid in Met. i. 140 ‘effodiuntur opes, irritamenta
malorum: iamque nocens ferrum ferroque nocentius aurum prodierat '‚
and as Horace in Od. iii. 3. 49 ‘aurum irrepertum et sic melius
situm cum terra celat ’. Cf. l. 1241 and following.

1115. Lambinus quotes Hor. Sal. ii. 3. 94 ‘ omnis enim res,
virtus, sama, decuS‚ divina humanaque pulchris divitiis parent'‚
and following.

sectam sequuntur, ‘follow in the train of! Catull. lxiii. 15
‘Gallae sectam meam exsecutae, duce me, mihi comites’; Cic.
Ν. D. ii. 22. 57 ‘ omnis natura habet quasi viam quandam et sectam
quam sequatur'.

1116. creti : see note on concreta, l. 798.

1117-35. It has been suggested that these lines on the evils of
ambition were written with reference to incidents in Memmius' life.

1118. vivere parce: the subject to sunt; notice the verb is
attracted into the plural by the plural predicate divitiae. Wake-
field quotes Hes. Op. 4ο νήπιοι, οὐδὲ ισασιν ὅσῳ πλέον ἥμισυ παντός,
i. e. enough is as good as a feast.

1 119. ‘ There is never lack of little?

1120. claros voluerunt se. Munro quotes Plaut. T rin. iii. 2. 38
⁸ curn te maxume clarum voles ’.

1123. succedere depends on certantes. Gray's Elegy ‘ the
paths of glory lead but to the grave’. We have ⁴ in summum
successit honorem', l. 1275.

1124. iter viai: so in ii. 626 ‘iter viarum '. For viai cf. 1. 946.

1126. invidia: either the envy of unsuccessful rivals (certantes,
1. 1124) or more probably, as Duff suggests, ‘this invidia bears
some resemblance to the Nemesis or envy of the gods in the old
mythology, which Lucretius utterly discards ’. In the same way in
ll. 1136-40 Nemesis falls on kings, and in ll. 1231—2 on fleets. For
the same reason, when a man was uncertain whether to marry
a rich lady above him in rank or a poor one of his own position,
Pittacus, the sage, advised him to choose the latter, telling him to
watch children spinning their tops in the street ancl saying each to
his own top τὴν κατὰ σαυτὸν ἔλαυνε, ⁴ keep in your own line '. Cf.
Arist. Clouds 25 ἔλαυνε τὸν σαυτοῦ δρόμον.

n· contemptim almost = contemptos predicative. Notice the t
a lteration.

1127. vaporant: vapore is found here only used intransitively
in sense of ‘burn ’, ‘are blasted by the breath ofenvy.' Aeschy-
lus gives a vivid description of Nemesis in P. V. 360 ὃς (Ζεὺς)
αὐτὸν ἐξέπληξε τῶν ὑψηγόρων κομπασμάτων. ἐφεψαλώθη κιῖξεβρον·
τήθη σθένος . . . κεραυνῷ Ζηνὸς ἠνθρακωμένος, where the thunderbolt
of Zeus fell on and blasted the boastful offender.

1128. et quae . . ., ‘ and all that is raised alost above the level of
other things!

quae . . . cumque: in tmesis; see on l. 883.

aliis : ablative of comparison, probably neuter as summa.

1130. Vergil holds a different opinion in Aen. vi. 8 51 ‘ tu regere
imperio populos, Romane, memento ’.
